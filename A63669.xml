            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Sieur du Queſne,</hi> General of the <hi>Maritine</hi> Forces of <hi>France</hi> with the Duke <hi>de Mortemar</hi> Lieutenant General, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Galleys, and the Marqueſs <hi>Seignelay</hi> Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of the <hi>Maritine</hi> Affairs, with a Fleet conſiſting of 20 Galleys, 10 Galliots, carrying each 2 Mortar-pieces for Bombes, 14 Men of War, 6 Fly-Boats, 18 Tartanes, 20 Chaloups, and 40 great Fiſher-boats caſt Anker on the 16th of <hi>May</hi> 1684. in the Port of <hi>Vade</hi> near <hi>Savona,</hi> depending on the Republick of <hi>Genova,</hi> and ſituated between <hi>Savona,</hi> and Final, the Fort of <hi>Savona</hi> ſaluted the <hi>French Fleet</hi> in the uſual manner, and ſhe anſwered accordingly. The ſame day being the 16th the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> ſent order to the <hi>French</hi> Conſul at <hi>Genova,</hi> for him to come on board, which he did, and next day being the 17th, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Genova,</hi> with Orders not to demand of the Republick, the Admiſſion of the <hi>French</hi> Navy into the Port; but to ſignifie to them they muſt clear the two Moles, to the end the Fleet might Anker there on the 18th, and this Meſſage was, performed with ſo much Authority and Haughtineſs, as if <hi>Monſieur de Seignelay</hi> had commanded in the Port of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where doubtleſs he would have ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; treating a Governour, that depends on the King his Maſter ſo rudely. The Republick made the moſt modeſt anſwer that could be, giving at the ſame time the reaſons, that hindred them from admitting that Fleet into their Ports, becauſe of the threats the moſt Chriſtian King had ſent them by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, at ſuch time as he uſed all good office in their behalf, with him by His Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittains</hi> order, and becauſe of the advice they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that that Fleet had not come out of the Ports of <hi>France</hi> upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign, but to brave that State, but however that ſhould not hinder them from giving them all the aſſiſtance they could in refreſhments, and any thing elſe they ſhould ſtand in need of: and the republick foreſeeing what the effects of their reſolution might be, ſent immediatly to haſten the March of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiment of Foot, which a little before, they had deſired of the Count <hi>de Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58069:2"/>Governour of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> to the end it ſhould be ready upon the Fronteers in caſe they ſhould ſtand in need of it. The ſaid Regiments uſed ſuch diligence in their March, that they Travelled 10 Leagues without reſting, and entred the Town of the 18th, at the ſame time that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet begun to appear, and draw up in Battel array, about a League and a half from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova.</hi> The Town ſaluted the Fleet as the cuſtom is, as much in regard of the number of Veſſels and Galleys, as of the Generals, who alſo anſwered as has been always uſed; and becauſe the Deputies that uſe to go to compliment the Generals, ſtaid ſomewhat long, the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> ſent to complain to the Republick, ſaying, he wondered they ſtayed ſo long, and immediatly Six Gentlemen Deputies went out to make him the ſaid compliment, and offer him the refreſhment which is uſually ſent; but inſtead of correſponding to the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Republick, the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> began to exaggerate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, that had been uſed towards the King his Maſter, adding a Thouſand impertinencies, and in concluſion gave them a Paper compoſed of ſo much haughtineſs, and ſo many extravagancies, that it ſeemed to have been dictated by the great <hi>Turk,</hi> the principal points whereof were, that the Republick ſhould yield up to the King their four new Galleys, and one of the others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly rigged and fitted for ſervice; ſhould ſend ſix of their principal Senators, to beg his pardon for their proceedings, and not having obeyed his Orders, to aſſure him they repent, and ſhall amend for the future: promiſing to obey and follow the Orders and Will of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty in all things, and ſo doing, they might perhaps find grace and pardon for their faults.</p>
            <p>The Deputies anſwered, they would make their report to the Republick, but this they could ſay they were moſt aſſured, they had done nothing that they ought to ask pardon for of His Majeſty, and knew the reſpect was due to his Royal Perſon; that the Republick never had fewer Galleys, and they well knew the Government loſt them, by the frequent prizes the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pyrats took of their proviſions, and they were now reſolved to oppoſe it and encreaſe the number of their Galleys, by four new ones, without the leaſt deſign of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any body, but to ſend them to joyn with the Pope's againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and thought in ſo doing, they had not failed of their reſpect towards His Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> made anſwer, that if neither five hours time he had not a ſatisfactory anſwer to what the writing, he had given them contained, he would execute the Orders he had from the King his Maſter.</p>
            <p>The Deputies being returned to the City, and having made their report to the Republick, who conſidering how the Marqueſs treated them in a minute by the full conſent of all reſolved to defend their liberty; and having to this effect given <hi>Don Carlo Taſſo,</hi> a Perſon of great underſtanding and capacity the neceſſary orders, and choſe him Camp Maſter General, and Governour of their Armes, the Republick in a very little time diſpoſed all things for a vigorous defence, giving the poſts that were moſt expoſed to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the term of five hours being elapſed, without their coming to any reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi>'s liking; the Enemies being buried in coming nearer the City, <hi>Don Carlo Taſſo</hi> gave the ſign with a ſmoke to make ready to fire; but whereas at the ſame time the enemies came nearer and deſiſted not at the ſecond ſign they began to diſcharge the Artillery on both ſides, and play upon each other vigorouſly, and the <hi>French</hi> to caſt their Bombes and Granadoes, by which the Palace of the <hi>Duke</hi> or <hi>Doge</hi> took fire the third day. The People began to take the fright, the confuſion growing the greater by the burning of two convents of Nuns, which were burnt to the ground, and are thoſe of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and St. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> whence the Nuns being retired in the night to ſecure themſelves, all the religious of the other Convents and Monaſteries did the ſame: in the mean time the People enraged againſt the <hi>French</hi> began to plunder all their houſes, and going yet farther, in a little time did the ſame to the other inhabitants houſes, but the General <hi>Don Carlo Taſſo</hi> ſpeedily remedied it with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> and <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Troops, the latter having come in the 20th day in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58069:2"/>morning; the general took and executed ſeveral of theſe Robbers, ſo that we may ſay <hi>Genova</hi> owes its preſervation to the arrival of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiments that came in ſo luckily. In Fine, the rabble of the City and that which had flocked in from the Country, was capable with the <hi>French</hi> to deſtroy the City, but God preſerved it. The Count <hi>de Melgor</hi> ſent alſo a detachment of the Country foot, and the reſt of the Army of <hi>Millain</hi> advanced to the Frontier of this State.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Melgar</hi> General and Captain General being come to <hi>Torto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> on the 21 of this month, to be nearer at hand for whatever ſhould happen, being advertiſed of the conſternation there began to be here many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and even of the Majeſtrates having left all with the fright of the fire and Bombes to ſave themſelves the Count advanced in perſon till this place, to calme the affrighted ſpirits with his preſents, and encourage them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and preſervation, and in effect it happened: inſomuch that from the time he came into the City, every body took courage, and in a moment all order was reſtored to the great ſatisfact, and conſent of the City and its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> continued caſting Bombes and Granadoes four days and three nights, and the 22th about noon they ceaſed and Monſteur <hi>de Seignelay</hi> ſent an Officer a ſhore with a <hi>Folucca</hi> who demanded to ſpeak with the Duke, but it was not granted, and he was forced to ſtay on board the Admiral Galley of the Republick in the Port, a Secretary was ſent to him from the <hi>Senate</hi> to know his meſſage who ſaid Monſieur <hi>de Seignelay</hi> much reſented the damage was done to the City, and if they reſolved to ſend Deputies, and were diſpoſed to give the King his Maſter ſatisfaction according as he demanded, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the protection of <hi>Spain,</hi> mercy ſhould ſtill be uſed; but if they obſtinatly perſiſt in the ſtate they are, he can let them know he had already ſpent 6000 Bombes againſt the City, but had ſtill 10000 left him, with which he would ruine the ſaid City, and gave a farther declaration of his intention in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. A Counſel was held in haſt, and the juncto of the Government anſwered that the Duke not being able to take any reſolution alone, he would aſſemble the Senate to give a poſitive anſwer: this was done to gain time and prolong this little truce, during which time the treaſure of St. <hi>George</hi> could be ſaved and paſt into a place of ſecurity, as was done that night, when part of it was removed to a ſafer place, choſe for that purpoſe. After which the <hi>French</hi> taking for a full anſwer that the Town was more fully reſolved than ever to defend it ſelf, they began on the 23d to play their canon upon the City, and endamage it with their Bombes and granadoes, though with leſs violence then before, and being they could not reach farther than they had, the people began to caſt of their fear, and remain firm againſt the threats of the <hi>French.</hi> The batteries of the City continued firing upon the Fleet, but without much damage to them, becauſe they kept out of the reach of Canon and the Gallies that carry the Bombes are proof againſt our Artillery.</p>
            <p>The 24th in the Morning the Enemies attempted two deſcents, one on the ſide of <hi>Biſagno,</hi> and the other on the ſide of St. <hi>Peter</hi> d' <hi>Arena,</hi> they were loaded with Bombes, Granadoes, Petards, Faggots, Scaling ladders and other warlike inſtruments, but thoſe two places being guarded by good Troops drawn out of the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Regiments they fought ſtoutly, and the <hi>French</hi> were quite driven from their poſts. On the ſide of <hi>Biſagno</hi> were taken 30 priſoners, moſt Officers, and Knights of <hi>Malta;</hi> among the deal was found the <hi>Sieur de la Motthe</hi> Captain of a man of War, much lamented among his People. At St. <hi>Peter de Arena</hi> there alſo remained many dead upon the place, Captain <hi>Don Antonio de Luna a Neapolitan Signalireh</hi> himſelf extremely, for having broke into the midſt of his Enemies with his Sword in his hand, he killed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and among the reſt a <hi>French</hi> Captain, and received a wound in his throat by a Musket ſhot; the <hi>French</hi> betook themſelves to a diſorderly Flight, leaving behind them Pick-axes, Mattocks, and other Inſtruments they had brought to fortifie themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58069:3"/>
            <p>The 25, 26, and 27. they continued caſting their Bombes with all poſſible fury, but <hi>Don Baſilio Marini,</hi> Lieutenant General of the Artillery of <hi>Millan,</hi> who the Count <hi>de Melgar</hi> had ſent to <hi>Genova</hi> with a number of Canoneers, having viewed the Order of the Galliots, whence the Enemies caſt their Bombs, and conſidered how he could beſt annoy them, reſolved to make ſome artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fire-works, and on the 28 came down towards the Sea, where he thought he could beſt reach them with his Calverins, and ſped ſo well that he ſunk one of the ſaid Galliots of the Bombes, and obliged the reſt to make off to Sea; and did alſo ſome damage to the Galleys.</p>
            <p>The ſame day being the Twenty eighth about noon, the <hi>French</hi> ceaſed caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Bombes, and ſent again a Shaloup to ſhore, and the Commander of the Veſſels of <hi>Genova</hi> having alſo advanced half a League in a Shaloup to meet him, and prevent his coming ſooner, he found there a Trumpeter with a Letter for a Captain of one of the Galleys of the Republick, called <hi>Lomellino,</hi> by which he was deſired to ſend word, whether <hi>Monſieur de la Motthe</hi> was a Priſoner and alive. He took the Letter to ſee what anſwer muſt be made, which was done, by letting them know that having viewed all the Priſoners, which are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he was not to be found.</p>
            <p>The ſame day about night, the <hi>French</hi> withdrew all their Galliots of Bombes, ſome ſmall Veſſels two Galleys and a Man of War, and gave demonſtration of ſome diſpoſition the whole Fleet would do the ſame, as appeared next day being the 29th at break of day, ſteering their courſe to the weſt-ward, and it is thought with intention to return to ſome port of Provance, whereby the City of <hi>Genova</hi> is left free, to the great ſatisfaction of the Republick, which openly confeſſeth it owes its preſervation to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> protection, and its arms which latred the City very ſeaſonably, and to the particular activity, wherewith the Count <hi>de Melgar</hi> always acted upon this occaſion.</p>

               <p>You have ruined his ſubjects by the ill uſage you have made them ſuffer in their commerce, and have been ſo perfidious, as to refuſe the propoſal we made to you, for allowing a Magazine of Salt to be made at <hi>Savona.</hi> It was in truth a thing of ſmall importance, but however has ſerved to diſcover the more how little reſpect you bear His Majeſty, and the difference you make between what concerns him and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ill a carriage deſerved an immediate puniſhment; but His Majeſty will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs of his goodneſs grant you time to repent, and take better meaſures.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58069:3"/>And that you may divert the effects of his juſt reſentments, you muſt preſently deliver into the hands of his Officers the four Galleys equipped, and give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well furniſhed with its company, ſo that it be in a condition to go immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly to Sea, you muſt depute four of your Principal Senators to beg pardon of His Majeſty, for your paſt miſcarriages, giving him ſufficient teſtimony of your entire Submiſſion to his Orders, in all things that ſhall be laid upon you by him, and in whatever hereafter he may have need of you either for his ſervice, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty allows you till five of the Clock in the Evening, to conſider upon his propoſals. But I declare to you on his behalf, that it is the laſt effect of his clemency, and goodneſs you are to look for, and that if within this time you do not accept of it, and ſuffer the firſt act of hoſtility to begin, you muſt no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hope to obtain ſuch moderate conditions; and the uſeleſs protection of <hi>Spain</hi> will not be able to ſecure you from a reſentment, that will be followed by the total ruine and deſtruction of your Country, and will make you feel how terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the effects of ſo great a Kings Indignation are.</p>

                  <hi>Given by an Officer of the</hi> French <hi>Fleet to the Secretary of the Republick.</hi> May <hi>the</hi> 22. 1684. <hi>at two in the Afternoon in the Admiral Galley of the moſt Serene Republick.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> ſends me to tell you, that he is much concerned to ſee the condition your Town is reduced to, and the diſmal effects of what he foretold you, before you had refuſed the propoſals he made you from the King.</p>
               <p>You may judge by the terrible deſtruction 6000 Bombes have made, what you are to fear from 10000 more that remain. And you ought not to doubt but he is in a better condition than before to make you fale their effects.</p>
               <p>We know what places in your <hi>City</hi> have ſuffer'd moſt, and ſhall for the future fire at the fartheſt that are not as yet prejudiced, ſo that you cannot hope one ſtone will be left upon another.</p>
               <p>Yet theſe great ils, are but inconſiderable compared with thoſe you muſt apprehend from the continuation of a War you are ſo unable to maintain.</p>
               <p>He will ſtill tell you, he has power to reconcile you to the King, ſo that all what is paſt ſhall be forgotten, and that putting your ſelves in a condition of hindring the burning of your Town, you may expect nothing but marks of protection from His Majeſty. If you accept his offers of Accommodation, you may ſend thoſe you ſhall think fit to agree the conditions, but if you perſiſt in your obſtinacy, and the vain hope you have placed in the Spaniſh Succors, and continue to reject the mercy the King is willing to grant you, all the world ſhall know you expoſed your ſelves of your own will to the invitable danger of looſing your City, and that by the refuſal you make of the advantages might be had in the Kings clemency and goodneſs, you have drawn upon your ſelves all the rigour of his Juſtice.</p>

               <p>His ſereneſs having heared the report I made him of what was ſaid to me from the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay,</hi> has ordered me to anſwer, that ſending of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties is a thing muſt of neceſſity be reſolved in Council, according to the Laws, and it ſhould be aſſembled the next day to that effect.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt that how great ſoever the damage received the laſt days was, it bore no proportion with the courage and reſolution of the Citizens for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58069:4"/>maintaining their liberty, beſides that the republick has all reaſon imaginable to be perſwaded, that it has given His Majeſty no occaſion to be thus uſed.</p>

               <head type="sub">Memoire <hi>of Mr.</hi> de Bonrepans <hi>Controuler of the Kings Fleet, to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Deputies of the Republick of Genova.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Since it appears by the anſwer given to the Major of the Fleet the Sir the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Seignelay's</hi> Deputy, that the neceſſity of aſſembling the Council, as well for the ſending of Deputies, as deliberating upon the propoſitions to be made, will require a conſiderable time, wheras a ſhort and ſatisfactory anſwer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, either to make all acts of haſtily quite ceaſe, or begin them again in a more ſenſible manner: the ſaid Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> declares that the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals he can make for the King his Maſter are, that the 4 new Galleys that were fited laſt year ſhall be delivered into the hands of His Majeſties Officers; that they ſhall be in a condition to go to Sea, and two ſhall be provided with men and guns.</p>
               <p>That the Republick ſhall give 600000 Liures in ready money, for part of the charges of the Fleet.</p>
               <p>That it ſhall depute 4 of its Principal Senators to the King, to beg of him to forget what is paſt, and give him new teſtimonies of their ſubmiſſion and reſpect.</p>
               <p>That a Magazine of ſalt ſhall be allowed to be made at Savona upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions already propoſed.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> moreover declares, that he can grant no longer time to deliberate upon theſe Propoſitions, then till 10 of the Clock next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if the Republick conſents to accept of them, they muſt ſend Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the neceſſary Authority to conclude with him; which failing, he ſhall ſee though with regret into what great inconveniencies it brings it ſelf, by fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with the greateſt Prince in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next he asked of the Secretary of the Republick, at what time the Counſel aſſembled, and he having anſwered at 14. which after our reckoning is 10, the other replied, that if the Anſwer could not be ſent preciſely at that hour, it would be well done to acquaint the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> at what hour Deputies could be ſent, in hopes that the Marqueſs being advertiſed, would make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of waiting a little longer.</p>
